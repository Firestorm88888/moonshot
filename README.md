# Shoot the Moon (like literally)

## Game Jam
An open-source game coded for [Github's Game Off 2020](https://itch.io/jam/game-off-2020).

## How to Play
Destroy a moon by shooting a laser at the moon in the fewest possible shots. The laser destroys all neighboring blocks of the same color, and the moon's gravity collapses the remaining blocks toward the center. You have a limited number of shots for each moon.
